1. Django
2. Python
3. Data structure
4. Algorithms
<br>
<h2>Pyhton and Django blogs:</h2>

&emsp; There are a couple of topic descriptions, code, and their results available\
&emsp; Ex: Exception handeling\
&emsp;&emsp; 1. In this, one can scroll down or simply click on the topic on the content list\
&emsp;&emsp; 2. There we can find a short description of exception handling \
&emsp;&emsp; 3. Syntaxes for the topic\
&emsp;&emsp; 4. A code snippet of divide by zero exception in a blue block.\
&emsp;&emsp; 5. The result after executing the code snippet in a green block.\

<h2>Algorithms and Data Structure blogs:</h2>

&emsp; This blog consists of a small description, a Python solution, and their results.\
&emsp; Ex : Insertion Sort\
&emsp;&emsp; 1. We can find the Time Complexity and Space Complexity of the algorithm.\
&emsp;&emsp; 2. A brief description of the process\
&emsp;&emsp; 3. The Insertion Sort program in Python in a blue block.\
&emsp;&emsp; 5. The result after executing the code snippet in a green block.\
